# Quarter-long Project

***([Copilot-generated placeholder for now]())*** The quarter-long project is a chance to apply the skills you've learned in the course to a real-world problem. You'll work in teams of 2-3 students to develop a solution to a problem of your choosing. You'll be expected to present your solution to the class and to the instructor.
