# CS 324 - Advances in Foundation Models

## Overview

Foundation models (FMs) are models (e.g., DALL-E, GPT-3, Stable Diffusion) that are trained on large amounts of broad data and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. They form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive generative and few-shot learning abilities. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals about the modeling, systems and ethical aspects of foundation models, as well as gain hands-on experience working with them. In addition, the course will feature speakers from industry working on these FMs. The key deliverable will be a quarter-long project through which students will design their own FM-based research project or application, targeting a problem they care about.

## Class 
This year, CS 324 classes are roughly divided into two halves of the quarter:  
1. **Weeks 1 - 4**: In the first half, we'll cover the fundamentals and "need-to-know" of foundation models, and provide a general survey of the field. A complete list of topics and related readings can be found https://michaelzhang.xyz/stanford-cs324-winter2023/syllabus/). The primary format will be lectures taught by course instructors.
 
2. **Weeks 5 - 10**: In the second half, we'll hear from guest speakers representing a diverse set of experiences building, using, and deploying foundation models in industry and academia for various use-cases and settings. Each class will feature a talk by one guest speaker, followed by a private Q&A.

A complete schedule of individual classes and topics can be found on the [Calendar]() page.
