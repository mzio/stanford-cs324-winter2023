# CS324 Class Topics / Syllabus (Winter 2023)

As a reading resource, please find a list of class topics and relevant materials below. Under each topic, we include a list of related readings, including lecture notes, blog posts, papers, and other resources.

We broadly organize class topics under three areas: [Fundamentals](#fundamentals), [Survey of Existing FMs and their Applications](#survey-of-existing-fms-and-their-applications), and [Societal Considerations & Impact](#societal-considerations--impact)

Note that these topics are *not in order* of when they'll be covered in class. Special thanks to the original content creators, including course notes from a [past version of CS 324](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/).
